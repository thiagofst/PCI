# Propagation of Confidence Interval (PCI)

PCI is a package for dealing with asymmetric probability distribution of parameters given by their confidence intervals.

Measurement values and its respectively confidence intervals are sampled with a pre-defined Probability Density Function (PDF), called as "Variable Width Gaussian", 
as proposed by R. Barlow (2004, "Asymmetric Statistical Errors").

The operations are performed by Monte Carlo simulation, it suports simple operations (+,-,*,/,**) and has support for generic functions to be created by the user.
